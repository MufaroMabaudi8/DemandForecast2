Project Title: Demand Forecast Based on Product Associations

Project Overview
This project is a demand forecasting system that integrates product association analysis to enhance demand predictions. The system should enable businesses to upload sales data, analyze product associations, and predict demand more accurately using machine learning models.

1. System Overview
The system is a web-based application that allows businesses to:

Upload historical sales data.

Analyze product associations using the Apriori algorithm.

Predict future demand using both historical sales data and identified product associations via a machine learning model (XGBoost).

View and export analyses and forecast results in graphical formats.

The system should be user-friendly, secure, and modular to allow easy upgrades.

Set minimum support and confidence thresholds (user-configurable).

Display progress/status.

Show output:
visualize the sales data (bar graph)

Frequent itemsets table.

Association rules table with support, confidence, lift.

Visualization (e.g scatter plots or heatmaps of product relationships).

View Product Associations


Visualization of associations.


Predict Demand (Forecasting Module)

automatically predict the demand of the product or associated products.

Use trained XGBoost model (integrated with association data as additional features).

Display forecasted demand (for selected future period: daily, weekly, or monthly).

Also predict demand for associated products.

Graphs: line charts, bar charts.
futuristic professional data visualization to display the trends

this is a hybrid demand system that incorporates sales data and product associations in order to predict the demand of individual products and also associated products . this helps in inventory management          

this system should be offline based 
create using python and flask 
apply a dark modern user interface 
system should be automatic , user  should only a dataset and everything should be automatic
