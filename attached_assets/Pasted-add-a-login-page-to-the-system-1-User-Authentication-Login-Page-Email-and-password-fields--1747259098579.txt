issue summary
Currently, the system is able to upload and detect the sales data, but it is not performing the following essential functionalities:(please fix)

Product Association Mining (Apriori) is not working or returning empty results.

Uploaded data is not visualized (sales trends, top products).

Demand forecasting module is not generating or displaying forecasts.

Required Fixes and Adjustments:
1. Product Association Mining (Apriori Algorithm)
Ensure the system:

Processes the uploaded data into a basket format (Transaction_ID grouped by Product_Name).

Applies the Apriori algorithm with adjustable thresholds:

Suggested default thresholds:

Minimum Support: 0.05

Minimum Confidence: 0.2

Handles cases with low data density by allowing the user to adjust thresholds.

Displays association rules clearly in a table with columns for Product 1, Product 2, Support, Confidence, Lift.

Visualizes product associations using graphs or association matrix.

2. Data Visualization Module
Implement automatic data visualization immediately after upload, including:

Sales volume by product (bar chart).

Sales trends over time (line chart).

Top-selling products (bar chart).



3. Demand Forecasting Module
Ensure the forecasting module:

Uses XGBoost to predict demand for individual and associated products.

Provides options to forecast:

Daily, weekly, or monthly demand.

Displays results in:

Forecast trend line charts.

Forecast summary tables (Predicted Quantity, Date).

Provides warnings if data is insufficient for forecasting.

4. General System Improvements
Ensure error handling and user notifications are clear and user-friendly:

Example: "No associations found. Try lowering the support threshold."

Example: "Insufficient data for demand forecasting."


Expected Outcome:
Fully functional system with:

Correct product association mining and visualization.

Data visualization of uploaded sales data.

Accurate demand forecasting module integrated and visible to users.
